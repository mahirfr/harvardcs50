              I come from the second youngest country in the world,
              HINT: South Sudan beat us in 2011 when it became the youngest.
              In 2015 I came to France with my family, finished high school
              in France and became a plumber in 2020 right after Covid lockdowns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed my time as a plumber but something was missing.
              I had that feeling for a while and one day all of sudden I stumbled upon a video
              talking about learning to code. I was pumped, the feeling disappeared.
              I got on to Google and typed "how to learn to code". The first site that popped up
              was <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>. My
              jorney to becoming a developer started right then and there !
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned some basic HTML and CSS and got my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/mahirilijazi/responsive-web-design">certification</a>
              for completing the challenges. This was in December of 2021.
              I was so excited, this was what I wanted to do all day every day !
              But some things at work weren't going that great, so I stopped
              taking the courses. Until I decided to quit my job and pursue a
              career in anything related to software engineering. I love it all !
              Planning, designing, developing, debugging or as I learned to descovered it's
              real name <strong>hitting your head against the wall</strong>, all of it !
            </p>
            <p>
              So here I am, week 8 of Harvard's amazing CS50 course, pumped as never before,
              and so excited to keep on learning new concepts, languages, algorithms and more.
              Btw, if you want to check out some of my solutions to CS50 challenges click
